I used AI assistance to accelerate development. Below are the prompts and what they helped with.

## 2025-10-28 – Layout, Safe Mode & Responsiveness
**Prompt:** “Make Safe Mode toggle change color, add WOW factor, make header responsive, prevent inappropriate anime.”
**What it helped with:** 
- Header layout (`page-head`, `head-right`) and mobile stacking CSS
- Safe Mode tint via `data-mode` + subtle animation (`mode-change` class)
- SFW filter using `isMature(rating)`
- Card/grid entrance animations
